# USM-CDS503-Machine-Learning
Project done under the course CDS503 during Master 

The dataset cource comes from Data.gov.sg, comprising the resale prices of the public housing of Singapore (HDB Flat) since January 2017 to April 2022.

There are 4 experiments studying:
1. the most suitable machine learning algorithm
2. the effect of feature selection
3. the use of ensembled learning
4. the effect of training data size

The result shows that:
1. KNN regression is the most suitable machine learning algorithm
2. feature selection does not really help to improve model performance
3. ensemble learning helps improve the performance of the model, with boosting (XGBoost) giving the best result
4. increasing the size of the dataset in this project also helps to improve the performance of the model
